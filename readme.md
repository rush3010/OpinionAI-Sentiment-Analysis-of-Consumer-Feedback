# OpinionAI: Sentiment Analysis of Consumer Feedback

### Project Overview
OpinionAI is a machine learning project designed to predict the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of food product reviews. This system aims to provide a reliable method for understanding consumer feedback using both rule-based and transformer-based approaches.

### Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, RoBERTa, VADER

### Project Highlights
- **Data Cleaning**: Utilized NLTK and spaCy for data preprocessing to ensure high-quality input for sentiment analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis Approaches**:
  - **VADER**: Implemented for initial rule-based sentiment scoring, providing a straightforward approach for sentiment classification.
  - **RoBERTa**: Leveraged the Hugging Face Transformers library for transformer-based sentiment analysis, capturing nuanced sentiment distinctions with higher precision.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Conducted a detailed comparison between VADER and RoBERTa, revealing that while both models performed well for positive and negative reviews, RoBERTa excelled in detecting neutral sentiments with greater accuracy.

### Results
The project highlighted the advantages of using advanced transformer models like RoBERTa for handling complex sentiment distinctions, making it a valuable tool for consumer feedback analysis. The comparative insights provided a clear understanding of each modelâ€™s strengths and limitations.

### Key Learnings
- The effectiveness of using different sentiment analysis approaches for diverse data scenarios.
- How transformer models can capture nuanced sentiments compared to traditional rule-based methods.
- Importance of thorough data preprocessing to achieve reliable analysis outcomes.
